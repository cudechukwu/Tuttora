## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend Services**
- **EmailNotificationService** - Core email handling service
- **Nodemailer Integration** - Professional email sending
- **Admin-Only Recipients** - Only admin users receive notifications
- **Error Handling** - Email failures don't break user actions
- **SMTP Configuration** - Works with Gmail, Outlook, and custom providers

### **Integration Points**
- **User Registration** (`auth.ts`) - Triggers on new account creation
- **Session Requests** (`sessions.ts`) - Triggers when students request help
- **Session Acceptance** (`sessions.ts`) - Triggers when tutors accept
- **Session Completion** (`sessions.ts`) - Triggers when sessions end

### **Database Integration**
- **Admin Detection** - Automatically finds users with `isAdmin: true`
- **User Details** - Fetches complete user and university information
- **Session Context** - Includes course details and session metadata

## 🚀 **Setup Required**

### **1. Email Configuration**
Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
SMTP_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
SMTP_PORT="587"
SMTP_SECURE="false"
SMTP_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
SMTP_PASS="your-app-password"
```

### **2. Gmail Setup (Recommended)**
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
2. Generate App Password in Google Account settings
3. Use the 16-character app password (not your Gmail password)

### **3. Test the System**
```bash
cd backend
npx ts-node scripts/test-email-notifications.ts
```

## 📊 **Management Tools**

### **Admin Management**
```bash
# List current admins (who receive notifications)
npx ts-node scripts/manage-admins.ts list

# Grant admin access (starts receiving notifications)
npx ts-node scripts/manage-admins.ts grant user@example.com

# Revoke admin access (stops notifications)
npx ts-node scripts/manage-admins.ts revoke user@example.com
```

### **Testing & Monitoring**
```bash
# Test email system
npx ts-node scripts/test-email-notifications.ts

# Check user analytics
npx ts-node scripts/check-user-analytics.ts
```

## 🛡️ **Security & Reliability**

- **Admin-Only Access** - Only users with `isAdmin: true` receive notifications
- **Secure SMTP** - Uses encrypted connections and app passwords
