# 🔐 Admin Dashboard Security Test

## ✅ **Security Implementation Complete!**

Your admin dashboard is now secure and only accessible to you. Here's what has been implemented:

### 🛡️ **Security Features Added:**

1. **Database Schema Update**
   - Added `isAdmin` boolean field to User model
   - Your account (`cudechukwu@wesleyan.edu`) is set as admin

2. **Backend Security**
   - `requireAdmin` middleware checks admin status before allowing access
   - Admin analytics endpoint: `/api/dashboard/admin-analytics` (ADMIN ONLY)
   - Admin Tpoints management endpoints (ADMIN ONLY)

3. **Frontend Security**
   - Admin dashboard shows appropriate error messages for non-admin users
   - Clear access denied messages with visual indicators

### 🧪 **How to Test:**

#### **Test 1: Access as Admin (You)**
1. Make sure you're logged in with `cudechukwu@wesleyan.edu`
2. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/admin`
3. ✅ **Expected Result:** You should see the full analytics dashboard

#### **Test 2: Access as Non-Admin**
1. Log in with any other user account
2. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/admin`  
3. ✅ **Expected Result:** "Access Denied" message with 🚫 icon

#### **Test 3: API Access**
```bash
# With your admin token (should work)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:5001/api/dashboard/admin-analytics

# With non-admin token (should return 403 Forbidden)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer OTHER_USER_TOKEN" http://localhost:5001/api/dashboard/admin-analytics
```

### 🔧 **Admin Management Commands:**

```bash
# List all current admins
npx ts-node scripts/manage-admins.ts list

# Grant admin access to someone
npx ts-node scripts/manage-admins.ts grant user@email.com

# Revoke admin access
npx ts-node scripts/manage-admins.ts revoke user@email.com

# Check admin status
npx ts-node scripts/manage-admins.ts check user@email.com
```

### 📊 **Quick Analytics Check:**
```bash
# Get current user stats anytime
npx ts-node scripts/check-user-analytics.ts
```

### 🚨 **Important Notes:**

- **Only you** (`cudechukwu@wesleyan.edu`) can access the admin dashboard
- All other users will see an "Access Denied" message
- Admin privileges are required for:
  - Viewing user analytics (`/admin`)
  - Awarding/deducting Tpoints
  - Accessing admin API endpoints
- You can grant admin access to other users if needed using the management script

### 🎯 **Current Status:**
- ✅ Your account is admin
- ✅ Admin middleware is active
- ✅ Frontend shows proper access control
- ✅ All admin endpoints are protected
- ✅ Build compiles successfully

**Your admin dashboard is now secure and ready to use! 🎉**
